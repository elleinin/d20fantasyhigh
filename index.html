                <p class="fhp">Created by and starring Brennan Lee Mulligan as your DM, Dimension 20's first season, Fantasy High, is a mash-up of classic High Fantasy with 80’s teen movies. Fantasy High seeks to answer the age old questions: “What if John Hughes ran
                    a game of D&D 5e?” and, “What would the Breakfast Club be like if the students all had swords and the principal was a wizard?” See all episodes of Fantasy High right here or on CollegeHumor's YouTube channel. Or see all three seasons
